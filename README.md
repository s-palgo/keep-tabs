#### Description: Chrome extension to be able to save your tabs and windows by clicking a button so you don't have to worry about losing them. Organizes your saved tabs/windows by date saved. Offers the ability to save tabs/windows, and to view, rename, and remove them.

## Why I Made This Extension
I decided to make this after I kept running into a problem when closing a bunch of tabs and later reopening them: the tabs would not reopen because some Chrome extension blocked them from reopening. So I had to email myself all the links in all my windows when I needed to close them for some reason to be able to access them later. So now I'm just creating this Chrome extension to save myself the hassle. 

Note: I'm pretty sure that an extension that does this probably already exists out in the real world, but I made my own extension anyways because why not.

More seriously, though, I could have just used Google Chrome's native functionality to save all open tabs to solve my problem, but I decided to make a Chrome extension myself because 
1. it's a good learning experience to reinvent the wheel and see what it takes to make a Chrome extension from scratch.
2. I wanted to be able to see when I saved my tabs/windows and for some reason Chrome doesn't offer that functionality, which was another driving factor in making this extension.

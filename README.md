# tabs

Chrome extension to be able to save your tabs and windows by clicking a button so you don't have to worry about losing them. 

I decided to make this after I kept running into a problem when closing a bunch of tabs and later reopening them: the tabs would not reopen because some Chrome extension blocked them from reopening. So I had to email myself all the links in all my windows when I needed to close them for some reason to be able to access them later. So now I'm just creating this Chrome extension to save myself the hassle. 

Note: I'm pretty sure that an extension that does this probably already exists out in the real world, but I want to make my own extension anyways because why not, and also because it will be a good learning experience for me to "reinvent the wheel" and see what it takes to build a Chrome extension from scratch.


Notes to myself: 

What the extension should have: 
- a button to click to save a window's tabs (user will have the option to give a name to that window)
- a menu or list which has all saved windows organized by the date they were saved 
- each saved window will have a button to open that window
- each saved window will have info about the # of tabs in that window
- if user clicks on a saved window, user should be taken to a page which displays that window's tabs (maybe as links, maybe as names of those tabs)
- (optional) a search bar to search for a saved window

# tabs

Chrome extension to be able to save your tabs and windows by clicking a button so you don't have to worry about losing them. 

I decided to make this after I kept running into a problem when closing a bunch of tabs and later reopening them: the tabs would not reopen because some Chrome extension blocked them from reopening. So I had to email myself all the links in all my windows when I needed to close them for some reason to be able to access them later. So now I'm just creating this Chrome extension to save myself the hassle.
